Compare the results:
1. Do you see any differences? If so, what are they?
2. Does one tracker perform better than the other? In what way?
   - Yes it's some differences between KCF and CSRT. But it has common features, for example in both cases, the "quality" of tracking
   - and processing speed depend on the selected tracking area.
   - For tracking dinamic moving car and every time changing view and scale of object on this video,CSRT did better:
   - CSRT - didn't lose tracking obj, support scaling, from time to time found tracking car after disapearing it from the screen.
   - KCF - low time tracking and lost the obj, not support scaling, lost tracking obj after dissapearing it from the screen.
